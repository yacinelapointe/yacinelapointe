Hello, I’m Yacine (she/her).

I speak English and French.

I hold an M.A. in Economics and have a strong interest in behavioral science, labor economics, and firm dynamics. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at McGill University in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, where I prepare and analyze wearables data, consumer transactions data, and geospatial mobility data.

I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, and LaTeX, and am expanding my skills in Markdown and SQL.

Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn (@Yacine Lapointe)!
