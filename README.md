Hello, I’m Yacine (she/her). 

I speak English and French.

I hold a M.A. in economics and I'm interested in behavioral science, labor economics and firm dynamics.
I’m currently working as a Research Assistant at McGill University in the Departement of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Global Health. I prepare and analyze wearables data, consumer transactions data, and geospatial mobility data.

I am proficient in R and Python programming languages, Latex, and looking to expand my skills in Markdown and SQL.

Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn (@Yacine Lapointe)!
